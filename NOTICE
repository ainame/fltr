The fuzzy matching algorithm (FuzzyMatchV2) in bokeh is inspired by and based
on the fuzzy matching algorithm from fzf. The scoring constants, bonus system,
and character classification approach are derived from fzf's implementation.

Specific inspired components:
- Sources/bokeh/Matcher/Algorithm.swift - FuzzyMatchV2 algorithm
- Sources/bokeh/Matcher/CharClass.swift - Character classification
- Sources/bokeh/Storage/Chunk.swift - Chunk-based storage design
